# Enhanced Reading
This is a Python project that aims to improve the reading experience by providing two useful features: summarization and sentiment analysis. The project is designed to be easy to use and can be integrated into any reading application or website.

###  Summarization
The summarization feature allows users to quickly get the main points of a text by generating a summary of the content. The summary is generated using natural language processing techniques and is designed to be concise and informative.

### Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis feature allows users to get a sense of the overall sentiment of a text by analyzing the words and phrases used. The analysis is performed using machine learning algorithms and returns a score indicating the overall positive, negative, or neutral sentiment of the text.

## Getting Started
To use this project, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Tensorflow 
  - huggingface 
  - nltk 
  Once you have these libraries installed, you can clone or download this repository and run the enhanced_reading.py file to start using the summarization and sentiment analysis features.
